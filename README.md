## Overview

For this analysis, we created a summary data frame that organized total rides, total drivers, total fares, average fare per ride, and average fare per driver and the multiple line plot for the rideshare company, *PyBer*. This analysis showcases the relationship between the type of the city -- urban, suburban and rural -- and their correlation between rides, drivers and fares, using data from January to early May of 2019, and focuses on the following: 

-	The total number of rides for each city type. 
-	The total number of drivers for each city type.
-	The sum of the fares for each city type.
-	The average fare per ride for each city type.
-	The average fare per driver for each city type.
-	The total fares for each week by city type. 

## Results

From the bubble data frame, we can see that there is a trend between how populated a city is and the total number of rides, which directly affects the total number of drivers, total fare, and both averages. Although the total number of rides, drivers and fares decrease as the cities become farther from urbanized areas, the average fare per ride and per driver seems to increase. This can be explained by the accessibility of PyBer rides and drivers in rural areas. Less drivers in rural areas may lead to a higher average fare per ride and driver, as prices increase when supply is low.

With the multiple-line chart, we are able to compare total fares by city type over a period of five months. All cities seem to follow the same trend throughout these months with the number of rides peaking at the end of February and fluctuating during March, while the trend in suburban cities shows a sharper increase during the month of April.

## Summary

There is a matching spike in February amongst each city type that should be looked further into along with the increase in suburban cities into April, while the other cities drop off. Since the ride fare in rural cities is higher than urban cities, it would be beneficial to see if allocating more drivers to rural areas would increase profits as the data shows that there may be a shortage in comparison to the demand. It may be to the benefit of the company to specify times of ride share data to indicate more profitable timeframes for rides and a possibility of raising fares when there is more demand.
